# A practical framework for choosing metrics

This draft introduces a practical metric selection framework for product and service analytics.

## Framework

- Outcome metrics: what business result should move.
- Driver metrics: what levers teams can influence weekly.
- Guardrail metrics: what should not degrade.

## Next update

This post will include a template for tradeoff analysis across metric tiers.
